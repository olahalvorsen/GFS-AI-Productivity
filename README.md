# 🤖 GFS AI Productivity Playground

**Welcome to our Github Copilot Capability Uplift sandbox!** 🎉

This isn't just another project - it's our **experimental laboratory** where we explore the incredible possibilities of AI-powered development! Think of it as our digital playground where brilliant minds come together to push the boundaries of what's possible with GitHub Copilot.

## 🎪 What's This All About?

We're on a mission to **supercharge our development capabilities** using GitHub Copilot, and this repository is our safe space to:

- 🧪 **Experiment freely** with cutting-edge AI coding techniques
- 🎓 **Learn from each other** and share mind-blowing discoveries  
- 🚀 **Break things and fix them** without any production worries
- 💡 **Innovate boldly** and see what amazing things we can build together
- 🎉 **Have an absolute blast** while doing it!

This is a **full-stack playground** built with React + .NET Core - perfect for testing everything from frontend wizardry to backend magic!

## 🚀 Ready to Jump In?

### What You'll Need
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+) - Your trusty companion ✅
- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) - Optional for now, but recommended for full experiments!

### Let's Get This Party Started! 🎊

1. **Grab the code**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/olahalvorsen/GFS-AI-Productivity.git
   cd GFS-AI-Productivity
   ```

2. **Install the goodies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run install:frontend
   ```

3. **Fire it up!**

   **Just want to see something cool? Start here:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   🌟 React app will spring to life at `http://localhost:3000`

   **Ready for the full experience?**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   🎯 This launches both frontend AND backend for maximum experimentation power!

### � Windows PowerShell Acting Up?

Don't let PowerShell slow down your experiments! If you see this grumpy message:
```
npm : File C:\code\node\npm.ps1 cannot be loaded. The file C:\code\node\npm.ps1 is not digitally signed.
```

**Quick Fix #1: Switch to cmd** (fastest way!)
```bash
cmd /c "npm install"
cmd /c "npm run dev"
```

**Quick Fix #2: Tame PowerShell**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Once everything's running, you'll have:
- 🎛️ **Backend API** humming at `http://localhost:5050` (check out the swagger docs!)
- ⚡ **Frontend React app** dancing at `http://localhost:3000`
